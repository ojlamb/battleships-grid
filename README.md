This repository houses code for Makers Academy Week 2 battleships project

Battleships is a game where each player has a board upon which they can place a number of ships. The boards are 10x10 two dimensional grid. Players switch off firing onto their opponents board attempting to hit the ships. Ships sink when the total number of hits taken equals the ships size. The game ends when all of a players ships sink.

The purpose of this project was to further my understanding of Object Oriented Programming, Behavioral Driven Design, and Test Driven Development. 

**To run:**
* ruby 2.2.1
